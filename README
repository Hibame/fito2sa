this is some pretty terrible php code to parse a copy+pasted
fitocracy workout, strip the points, and add some SA formatting
so the workout headers are in bold, rep lines begin with a dash,
and comments are in italics. it should work with chrome and
firefox's methods of c/p, haven't tested it with MSIE
